ZBank process to set up blockchain testnet
1. Open a terminal window, navigate to the `Blockchain-Tools` folder and type the following command:
* ./geth --datadir node# (# - enter a number for the node)
 ![node3](screenshots/node3.png)
create a second node using the same command
 ![node4](screenshots/node4.png)

2. Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `Blockchain-Tools` folder and type the following command:

 ```bash
 ./puppeth
 ```
 This should show the following prompt:

 3. Type in a name for your network, like "zbank" and hit enter to move forward in the wizard.

* Type `2` to pick the `Configure new genesis` option, then `1` to `Create new genesis from scratch`:

 4. Now you have the option to pick a consensus engine (algorithm) to use.

* Type `2` to choose `Proof of Authority` and continue. Type  `15` for the amount of seconds for each block should take.

5. You will be asked to enter an account to seal. Enter the public key from the nodes you created in step 1

* Copy and paste a the public address from your first node, without the `0x` prefix and hit enter.
* Copy and paste a the public address from your second node, without the `0x` prefix and hit enter.

* Repeat the same step for the entering the accounts to seal for which accounts to prefund.

* Once you paste an address and hit enter, hit enter again on the blank `0x` address to continue the prompt.

* Continue with the default option for the prompt that asks `Should the precompile-addresses (0x1 .. 0xff) be pre-funded with 1 wei?` by hitting enter again,
 until you reach the `Chain ID` prompt.
 * Come up with a number to use as a chain ID (e.g. `333`) type it, then hit enter.

 * When you come back to the main menu, choose `2` `Mange existing genesis`

 6. First, export your genesis configuration into a `yournetworkname.json` file as follows:

* In the `puppeth` prompt, navigate to the `Manage existing genesis` by typing `2` and hitting enter.

* You may have to type your network name again first if you're launching `puppeth` fresh.

* Then, type `2` again to choose the `Export genesis configurations` option, and continue with the default (current) directory by hitting enter:

* This will export several `yournetworkname.json` files -- you only need the first one without `aleth`, `parity`, or `harmony` suffixes.

* Exit `puppeth` by using the `Ctrl+C` keys combination.

 * Confirm Puppeth configuration by going to the `blockchain-tools` folder and navigating to the folder you created when you downloaded the json files.

Now, it's time to initialize and tell the nodes to use your genesis block!

* Initialize the first node, replacing `yournetworkname.json` with your own:

 ```bash
 ./geth init yournetworkname.json --datadir node#
 ```

You should see this success message:

![geth init](screenshots/init-json-node3.png)
![geth init](screenshots/init-json-node4.png)

* Since you only initialize your nodes once, you don't need to copy anything into your notes here.

* Run the same command for `node#`.

 ```bash
 ./geth init yournetworkname.json --datadir node#
 ```
 * Unlock your nodes by running the following commands
 ./geth --datadir node3 --unlock "2caa4135906695f7722e80ee91ae64c9019ed085" --mine --minerthreads 5

./geth --datadir node4 --unlock "ff926a17f27098cc01156f908bdd549fcfcec46b" --port 30304 --rpc --bootnodes "enode://71f3f621286f8d7ebf9f70e35274956e09d7f4e308e08faedddfdd80462d7c8057cd082931526fbd5ef2d10c5e67651ceaaa4e2aed2c5e8196df046ad0294a76@71.172.6.7:30303" --ipcdisable â€”allow-insecure-unlock

7. * Open `mycrypto` app on your desktop.
* Select `Change Network`
* Scroll down to the bottom and select `custom network`
* When the popup appears
![change network](screenshots/custom-network.png)
* Enter the information from the creation of the genesis account.
* On the next screen `how to access your wallet` select `keystore file`. Select your first `node` you created. Enter your `blockchain tools password` Once you do that your screen should look like this:
![mycrypto setup](screenshots/mycrypto-setup.png)
* Copy down the account addres.
* Select `Change Wallet`
* Repeat the step above and select the second node you set up.
![mycrypto4](screenshots/mycrypto4.png)
* Copy the first account address and paste it into the `To Address` field.
* Enter the amount. press `send transaction`
* You should receive a confirmation that the transaction went through
![confirmation1](screenshots/confirmation.png)
* Select TX Status in the banner. It will bring you into the transaction status. It will go from Pending to Completed.
